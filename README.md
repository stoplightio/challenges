# Stoplight Code Tests

Ready. Set. Go!

1.  `yarn setup` to install deps.
2.  `yarn test.watch` to start the test runner.
3.  Get as many tests to pass as possible.

Add `.only` to any test case to isolate it, for example:

```js
test.only('only this test will run', async () => {});
```

Find more information in the `packages/resolver/README.md`.
